# üìä Log & Error Analyzer for Android Java Apps

This project provides a simple, user-friendly interface for analyzing `.log` and `.txt` files generated by Android Java applications made in python. It's especially useful for developers working with mobile apps who need to identify and understand errors, crashes, and warnings from log files. 

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** Running the `.exe` file might trigger a security alert since it's unsigned. Rest assured, it is **not a virus** ‚Äî it simply performs offline log analysis.

## üîç What It Does

The tool uses a `.json` file as a **reference database of known errors and crash patterns** typically found in Android Java apps. You can:

- Analyze a single log file manually.
- Analyze multiple log files across **different folders** automatically.
- Rename bulk files based on:
  - The **date** found in the log
  - The **folder name** they were found in

It helps you quickly detect issues like `NullPointerException`, `OutOfMemoryError`, or any other error type defined in your JSON error database.

## üß† How It Works

1. **Reads Log Files:**
   - You can drag and drop or select individual `.log` or `.txt` files, or point it to a folder to scan all logs inside (and subfolders).
   
2. **Renames Log Files:**
   - Files are automatically renamed using a pattern like:  
     `YYYY-MM-DD_<foldername>.log`

3. **Analyzes Using the `.json` Error Dictionary:**
   - The tool checks each line for matches from the `.json` file.
   - Every match is counted, categorized, and reported.

4. **Generates Two Output Files per Analysis:**
   - `summary_report.txt`: A brief overview listing each error/crash found, with counts.
   - `detailed_report.txt`: A deeper report showing the **exact lines**, **frequency**, and **file locations** for each error.

5. **Repeatable Workflow:**
   - You can update the `.json` file anytime with new error patterns.
   - Re-run the tool to scan again using the updated definitions.

## üìÅ JSON File Structure

The `.json` file acts as the brain of the operation. It contains error keys and associated search patterns like:

```json
{
  "NullPointerException": "java.lang.NullPointerException",
  "OutOfMemoryError": "java.lang.OutOfMemoryError",
  "CrashLoop": "FATAL EXCEPTION"
}
# LogExceptionAutomation
Log Exception Automation. Purpose to choose different options to analyze for errors and exceptions.

## ‚úÖ Requirements
Windows OS (for .exe usage)

Logs in plain text (.log or .txt)

A properly structured errors.json file

## üöÄ Getting Started
Place your .log or .txt files in one or more folders.

Run the .exe file.

Choose between analyzing:

A single file

A folder with multiple logs

The program will:

Rename files (optional)

Analyze them

Generate output reports in the same or a specified folder

## üìå Notes
Make sure to allow the .exe to run if your antivirus flags it. It‚Äôs just a local tool.

The .json file is editable. You can add, remove, or modify entries to tailor the error detection to your app.

The analyzer can be re-run anytime.

## üõ† Future Plans
Export reports in CSV or HTML

GUI version with drag-and-drop support

Integration with real-time log viewers
